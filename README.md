# ANNR

Official implementation of the Active Nearest Neighbor Regressor (ANNR) for active function approximation.

## Structure

Repository contains two separate implementations:

* **annr-python**, a lightweight Python implementation of the algorithm with two-dimensional examples. See `annr-python/README.md` for details
* **other thing**, a complete C++/Python implementation of the algorithm, including approximate Delaunay computation for arbitrary dimensions.
